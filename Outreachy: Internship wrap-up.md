It's the last week of my [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) internship with [Wagtail](https://wagtail.org/). My appreciation goes out to Outreachy for giving me this lifetime experience.

Working on the [Wagtail user guide documentation](https://guide.wagtail.org/) project, as an Outreachy intern gave me my first paid professional experience as a technical writer.

Furthermore, I have gained many valuable skills by working on the Wagtail user guide documentation. Among these skills are:

* software and information architecture
    
* advanced writing skills
    
* copywriting
    
* gap analysis
    
* user research
    
* project presentation
    
* asynchronous communication
    
* open collaboration
    
* Python programming language
    
* Django web framework
    

Besides gaining valuable skills during this internship, working with some of the most experienced professionals I've ever met as mentors is exciting. The most exciting experience I had while working on the Wagtail user guide was getting to present to Wagtail's core team. That single experience instilled in me a lot of confidence.

## Progress update on the Wagtail user guide documentation

The Wagtail user guide documentation project remains unfinished. I was able to do the following on the Wagtail user guide documentation:

* Improve the architecture of the documentation.
    
* Implement a style guide.
    
* Revamp the existing content.
    
* Introduced a new [Concepts](https://guide.wagtail.org/en-latest/concepts/) section.
    

The tasks remaining in the user guide documentation are as follows:

* Add a quickstart tutorial.
    
* Add the content for the Reference section of the documentation.
    
* Implement an internal navigation that shows which section of a page a user is reading.
    

To aid future contributors, I have submitted some reports as issues on the Wagtail user guide documentation repository. The reports serve as references for subsequent contributors interested in working on the project.

## My post-Outreachy plans

Outreachy has shown me how quickly I can learn and get things done if I'm an active member of a functioning community. After Outreachy, I intend to work on the Wagtail developer documentation. I also intend to continue learning the core technologies used in building the Wagtail CMS.
