As the end of my [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) internship with [Wagtail](https://wagtail.org/) draws nearer, my focus has been on understanding the core technologies of the Wagtail CMS. As of yet, this has involved learning a new programming language and completing numerous programming tasks.

In [last week's article](https://activuscode.hashnode.dev/outreachy-week-eleven), I shared with you some challenges I faced while learning the core technologies used in building the Wagtail CMS, particularly the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) web framework. In this week’s article, I share with you how far I’ve gone with my learning of Django and the tasks I've completed.

## Week twelve in review

I've made more progress learning the Django web framework. It took me a little while to understand how the framework works, especially its structure and syntax.

To facilitate my learning, I completed the [fourth programming task](https://github.com/wagtail/guide/issues/301) given to me by my mentors. The task builds upon the [third programming task](https://github.com/wagtail/guide/issues/299) I completed earlier. The task required me to create a Django route and view that checks the URL and automatically redirects a URL request for a non-existent Wagtail version to the homepage.

After completing the fourth programming task, I am glad to inform you that I’m now able to set up a simple Django project with multiple applications. I can do this without consulting any of my learning resources. This took a lot of practice and debugging.

Also, I started the programming challenge given to me by one of my mentors, [Storm](https://github.com/stormheg). The challenge is to build a web library application with Django. The application should display a list of books. Each of these books should have an author, a title, and an **ISBN (International Standard Book Number)**. Also, clicking on the book should take the user to a page that displays the details and a short overview of the book. Additionally, users of the website should be able to search for any book by its author, title, or ISBN.

## The week ahead

In the coming week, I’m going to continue learning the Django web framework by completing the programming challenge given to me by [Storm](https://github.com/stormheg). In addition, I plan to curate the ideas that I want to work on for the Wagtail project after my Outreachy internship ends.
