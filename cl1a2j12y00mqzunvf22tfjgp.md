# Introduction

The Internet has revolutionised the computer and communications world like nothing before. For most of us, the internet is nothing more than our Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, or any other social networking platform we use. However, the answer to what the internet really is can be complex, one which anyone interested in software engineering is expected to understand.

In this write-up, I would discuss the origin of the internet and attempt to simplify the complexity of what the internet is as much as possible to allow for basic understanding.

# A Brief History of the Internet
The internet was based on the idea of having multiple independent networks that can communicate with one another by which the destruction of one or more networks would not lead to a total collapse of the entire infrastructure. It is the brainchild of the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), a research agency launched by the US Department of Defence in 1958, as a direct response to the threat of technological domination by the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union had earlier launched what was the first satellite (Sputnik 1) in 1957 and the US feared an attack on its networking infrastructure from the space, thus causing a need to invent a new networking infrastructure that can withstand such attacks. Subsequently, in 1996, ARPANET, the first wide-area packet-switched network with distributed control was developed by ARPA based on the ideas of J. C. R. Licklider, Bob Taylor, who were directors of the agency. ARPANET grew into today's internet. Without the earlier success of ARPANET, the internet as we know it today would not exist.

# What is the Internet?
Simply put, the internet is a collection of networks that allow different computers to communicate and share information with one another. This is the main reason the internet is tagged as a "network of networks". The internet as we know it today has evolved and has been integrated into different aspects of human lives such as mobile communication, eCommerce, email, financial services, gaming. The belief is that today over half of the human population is active internet users worldwide.

# How Does the Internet Work?
For a better understanding of how the internet works, I would use the analogy of you trying to watch a video on YouTube. The video you are about to watch on YouTube is stored specifically in a server within a data centre thousands of miles away from you. For the video to get to your mobile phone or PC, it has to travel as light pulses through a complicated network of optical fibre cables which connects between the data centre and cellular data or any Wi-Fi router. Your device would then retrieve the video from either the cellular data or Wi-FI router it is connected to. To comprehend this fully, I will explain some important concepts and functions involved in this process, which allow the internet to work efficiently:


## Circuit Switching Versus Packet Switching
Prior to ARPANET, the dominant mode of networking was the traditional circuit switching. Circuit switching is the technology behind the telephone network and it has only one path dedicated for connection. This means that when you make a call, a physical connection gets established during the session and a dedicated circuit is always present to handle the data transmission back and forth between the two ends of the communication. The major disadvantage of this is that once a connection is established between two users using circuit switching, it becomes impossible to transmit any other data through the dedicated circuit until the session is over. The effect of this is that if you are using a telephone to make a call to your friend, it won't be possible for another friend to reach you on the same phone until the first call session you started is ended.

This major disadvantage of circuit switching caused the need to develop another mode of networking that would allow multiple users at the same time. The development of packet switching fixed the challenge posed by circuit switching. Packet switching is the underlying technology behind the internet as it allows data to be divided into smaller blocks referred to as packets. Each block of data can then take a different route to reach the same destination where the blocks would be re-compiled into the original message sent. To use our earlier analogy, the video sent from the YouTube servers would be split into several parts, which would then travel via different available routes and then be reassembled when they get to your device to form the full video originally sent from the servers.

## IP Address
Since computers need to communicate with one another via the internet, each computer using the internet must have a unique mode of identification. This mode of identification is the IP address, which stands for internet protocol address. an IP address is like an Identification Number which is usually unique to that computer. These numbers allow routers to identify where they are sending information to or where they are receiving it from. IP addresses are expressed as a set of four numbers. An example of an IP address might be 192.158.1.38. Each number in the set can range from 0 to 255. So, the full IP addressing range goes from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255.
For instance, if you are connecting to the internet from your mobile network, your device would first be connected to your network provider, usually referred to as ISP (Internet Service Provider). Your network provider would assign to your device an IP address since they are the one providing the internet access and the address would be used to locate and route back data to you from the internet. In the same vein, every web server and router also has their unique IP address to be used to identify it.

## DNS
DNS translates to Domain Name System, and it is the directory for IP addresses. DNS usually has a Domain name used for easy identification of IP addresses. As we have seen earlier, there are several IP addresses, and it is difficult to remember every one of them. We can see DNS as a mobile phonebook that usually has the name and number of a contact and, with DNS, a domain name and an IP address. A domain name can be assigned to more than one IP address. For instance, while the domain name of YouTube is ```youtube.com``` they have several IP addresses, some of which are: 208.65.153.238, 208.65.153.251, 208.65.153.253. Note that a domain name differs from a URL.

## Protocol
Since there are several networks each with its internal processes, structure and design trying to communicate with another, it becomes imperative that there should be a set of pre-defined rules and guidelines that computer-related devices follow to enable network communication or exchange of data. More simply, a protocol is like the general language accepted as the mode of communication by computers. Without a protocol, it would be difficult for the receiving device to understand the message sent, thus making it impossible to assemble the received packets. There are several types of protocols in use today for enabling communication between devices across the network common among which are Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), Internet protocol (IP), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS).

### Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
TCP is a popular communication protocol that is used for communicating over a network. It divides any message into a series of packets that are sent from source to destination and there it gets reassembled at the destination. TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, as it requires a connection to be established between applications before data transfer.

### Internet Protocol (IP)
IP is designed explicitly as addressing protocol. It is mostly used with TCP. The IP addresses in packets help in routing them through different nodes in a network until it reaches the destination system. TCP/IP is the most popular protocol connecting the networks.

### Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
Simple mail transfer protocol manages the transmission and outgoing mail over the internet.

### File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
File transfer protocol is used for transferring files to different networks. There may be a mass of files, such as text files, and multimedia files. This way of file transfer is quicker than other methods.

### HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
HTTP is an application layer protocol used for distributed, collaborative, and hypermedia information systems. It works on a client-server model, where the web browser acts as the client. Data such as text, images, and other multimedia files are shared over the World Wide Web using HTTP. As a request and response type protocol, the client sends a request to the server, which is then processed by the server before sending a response to the client.

### HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)
HTTPS is used for transferring data between the client browser (request) and the web server (response) in the hypertext format just as with HTTP except that in HTTPS the transfer of data is done in an encrypted format.

# Conclusion
Now we know that using the internet is simply the act of requesting a server located somewhere in the world for some data. The data is then sent from the server upon confirming the request in the form of light pulses in bits using specialised cables adapted specifically for that function, and the data bits are re-assembled to form the original message upon reaching its destination.
